Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering concepts ,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. Its importance in technology is protecting against cyber security threats by incoporeting practices to ensure protection of sensitive data and prevent breaches. Also it adapts to the frequent technological changes.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering has evolved rapidly, example of such evolutions is development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C). The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements -Its gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. 
Design-Its Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implemantation- Its writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing - Its conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - Its releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance- Its providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is the sequintal approach wit distinct phases flowing down like a waterfall while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools that are used for writting,testing and debugging code eg Eclipse
VCS are tools that are used for tracking changes in source code and coordinating work between team members eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines giving poor quality software products,solution is to have ready code which can be manipulated as per the clients requirements.
Technical debt where the solution is to do the work to completion

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing individual components or modules of software.
Intergration testing is the testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing is the testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing is the testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is  about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It elps in gettin the best answer for your question.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Tell me about a car
can you tell me about the mercedes c class
